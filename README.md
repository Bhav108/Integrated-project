# Integrated-project - Bhavana Harriparsad
This project focuses on the insurance industry in the African markets. As there is < 1% that are insured in Africa, there is large room to increase revenue.
However, there are various other factors that need to be considered i.e. household income, unemployment rate, to name a few.

The project began by gaining insights into the market to understand the problem and define a problem statement.
A problem landscape was created to better understand the problem and identify the necessary resources required.

To keep track of the project from initial stage to completion, a Trello board came in handy.

Once the insurance data was obtained, analysis was conducted and feature engineering was performed (eg. imputing null values) in excel.
There was also an element of feature engineering performed in Jupyter Notebooks.
A comprehensive dashboard was created on Power BI which reflects an enhanced visualisation of the data to provide more insights on the insurance industry and identify gaps that can be capitalised.
